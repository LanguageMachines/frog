0.18.1 - 2019-06-19

Bug fixes and enhancements:

This release supports FoLiA 2.0
* some bug fixes
  - trust the tokenizer to get the default language
  - don't stumble upon empty sentences introduced by a non-breaking-space
  - provenance data is added for all the modules

0.16 - 2019-05-15
[Ko vd Sloot]
This is the last release using pre FoLiA 2.0
It includes a total rework of the Frog Internals, aiming at better
maintainability and hoping for a speedup and a smaller memory footprint.
This work will continue in the upcoming release for FoLiA 2.0

Major Changes:
* total rework. Not using a FoLiA document as the internal datastructure anymore
  but a FrogData structure.
* use folia::engine for all FoLiA processing
* -Q option is NOT supported anymore. It was unreliable anyway
* builds on the newest ucto versions only
* fix for https://github.com/proycon/LaMachine/issues//135
          https://github.com/LanguageMachines/frog/issues/66
* handles some corner cases in FoLiA better
* lots of code cleanup
* numerous small fixes ( e.g. in NER and MBMA results)
* improved working of --languages option
* avoid invalid FoLiA: https://github.com/LanguageMachines/frog/issues/60
* fixed memory leaks
* better handling of weird FoLiA

[Maarten van Gompel]
* added skeleton for new Frog documentation

  the docID (filtering out non-NCName characters)
* fix building the documentation from TeX files
* a lot of small code improvements

[Maarten van Gompel]
* added codemeta.json
* Fixed python-frog example in documentation (closes #48)
