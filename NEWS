* also some minor leaks are plugged

0.29 - 2023-05-05
[Ko van der Sloot]

  (where Frog created invalid FoLiA in a cornercase)
* improved api_test
* small code refactorings

0.27.2 - 2023-02-23
[Maarten van Gompel]

0.27.1 - 2023-02-22
[Maarten van Gompel]
* Software metadata update only, no functional changes

0.27 - 2023-02-22
[Ko van der Sloot]
* Major Release.
* Internally we always perform a 'deep' morphological analysis.
* This information is used for XML and JSON output.
* For the 'classic' Tabbed output, we maintain backward comptability.
* You need to specify '--deep-morph' to get the deep analysis in the output.
* You may also specify '--compounds' to get an extra column with compound
  information.

Other changes:
* C++ code quality
* adapted to more recent Timbl implementations (Unicode awareness)
* Tokenizer:
  - Better handling of --languages option.
  - 'und' is now also acceptable as a "language"
  - Better debugging possibility
* Mbma: To many alternatives with Inverted Verbs were generated. As the
        Tagger doesn't help us directly, we filter on the person of the next
	word, and only return V/te2I when the next word is 2-nd person

[Maarten van Gompel]
* merged a patch suggested by Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>
  - configure.ac: Bug#993123: frog FTCBFS: hard codes the build
    architecture pkg-config Source: frog Version: 0.20-2
      Tags: patch upstream User:
    debian-cross@lists.debian.org Usertags:
      ftcbfs frog fails to cross build from source, because configure.ac hard
      codes the build architecture pkg-config in one place (after
      correctly detecting the host architecture one). Simply using the
      correct substitution variable makes frog cross buildable. Please
      consider applying the attached patch.
